    LETS GET THE TEAM BACK TOGETHER AGAIN!

      <h2>It's time for Mayor Queen to resign.</h2>
      <p>It should be said that Season 6 is a different beast than previous seasons of Arrow. For most of 
	     the show’s lifespan, the winter finale has been an opportunity to dazzle the fans before leaving 
	     them at the edge of their seat. Historically, the winter finale has been a time for master plan r
	     eveals (Season 1), the fate of characters left unknown (Season 3, Season 4), or just plain shocking
	     everyone with twists no one can explain (Season 5).
	  </p>

      <p>With Season 6, however, Arrow has tapped into an existential question: What is the point of all
	     this? Dressing up in costume, fighting crime, all at the sacrifice of a healthy lifestyle? 
	     The disintegration of Team Arrow, a group of superheroes who have gone to hell and back just
	     to bond together, signals that Arrow, much like The Last Jedi taking in 40 years of Star Wars 
	     franchise history, is re-examining itself without completely shattering the fourth wall
	  </p>

      <p>This one is kind of expected. Basic storytelling requires that protagonists be at their lowest
	     point before the third act, and from a certain perspective, every show’s third act are those episode
	     s that finish off a season. Everyone split apart and hating each other is a pretty low “low point.”
	     Still, no team can stay apart forever. It’s kind of inevitable that Team Arrow will reunite as one
	     force to fight Cayden James’s thus far unnamed alliance of bad guys, none of whom are super-villains
	     save for Black Siren. Yeah, they want to blow up the world or something, but unlike Ra’s Al
	     Ghul or Deathstroke, Cayden is a pretty mid-tier threat. His villainy ain’t important,
	     it ’s whether or not Team Arrow can get their shit back together.

  <p>Get back together they just might. But could Thea Queen, who has recently woken up from a coma, 
     return in fighting shape to become Speedy? In “Irreconcilable Differences,” Thea admitted that
     she’s not as strong as she used to be, but it can’t take much to whip her back into shape.
     That’s why the Arrow Cave is stocked like an industrialized Crunch Fitness. Depending on
     Willa Holland’s involvement in the series, which showrunner Marc Guggenheim says hasn’t 
     changed since Season 5, perhaps Speedy will suit up again. If only for one or two more rounds.
  </p>
  <p>It’s too much for Oliver Queen to be mayor. The walls are caving in, and it’s time for Mayor Queen
     to abdicate his position. Not just because it’s gotten a little boring, but because Arrow is running 
     out of stakes for Oliver to lose. The insanity of being a vigilante and a public official aside, 
     “Mayor Queen” has exhausted pretty much all avenues the story could go. Of course, Arrow could 
     have used the opportunity to explore real socio-political issues; police brutality, systemic racism
     , income inequality, women’s rights, the unfortunate rise in white nationalism—America, and indeed
    the world, could only benefit from a pissed-off, Woke Green Arrow on television would have been 
    just as welcome as the Green Arrow in the comics was. Plus, a rich white asshole who inherited his
    f ortune and fell into civic office is a very timely idea that Arrow didn’t make the most out of. 
    With Oliver Queen under suspicion again, for what feels like the 200th time, it’s now the hour 
    for Oliver Queen to resign.
  </p>
  <p>He’s barely a teenager, but William’s entire Season 6 arc — to have his father retire from being
     a superhero — only sets him up for the inevitable: William to become a vigilante archer himself.
     Bruce Wayne started training to become Batman at roughly the same age, so if William starts now
    , he’s on track to surpass his father by the time he’s 30.Just imagine this final image: In the
    backyard of the old Queen residence, William takes up a bow and arrow, and gets a bullseye.
    No, he doesn’t need a mask or a costume, not yet. Just an acknowledgement that Oliver passed
    on his killer instincts to his son, though something of a Greek on its own, would be a hell
    of a way to close Season 6 and look forward to Season 7.
