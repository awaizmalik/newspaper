      <h2>Gotham Season 4 </h2>
      <p>The fourth season of Gotham is underway in the US, and if you're watching 
	  along this will now be your one stop shop for all the news that's fit to print, 
	  including interviews, trailers, preview images, and occasionally some spoilers for

      <p>Be it VIP tickets to polo matches in the Hamptons, the ability to make a five-way 
	  phone call on a flip phone while sitting in a limousine, or swiping the family credit
	  card in shops down Fifth Avenue, there was pretty much nothing we didn't want from the
	  fictional lifestyles of Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf from Gossip Girl.</p>

      <h2>Young Sheldon</h2>
      <p>It’s rare that the Hollywood industrial complex so flagrantly wags its hatred for the thick,
	  heaving masses, but with Young Sheldon it has quite literally lifted lines from its most popular
