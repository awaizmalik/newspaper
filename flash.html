    BREAKING NEWS : THE FLASH RETURNS
  </h1>

      <h2>He's back!</h2>
      <p>2017 was quite the interesting year for The Flash. The CW’s hit superhero drama kicked 
	     off the year on a low note with the back half of its third season which was panned for taking
	     itself too seriously and getting too dark. Luckily, the show was able to end the year on a high 
	     note with what has proven to be quite the memorable fourth season thus far; a season which has
	     returned to form to bring back the show’s lighter and comedic tone. 
	  </p>

      <h6> &nbsp; </h6>
      <p>With the year coming to a close, it seemed like as good as time as any to reflect upon the year’s 
	     momentous moments – both good and bad. What better way to do so than by celebrating the characters 
	     and moments that managed to get fans talking throughout the year via superlatives designed to shine
	     a light on both the best and worst The Flash had to offer in 2017. From the show’s best new addition
	     and greatest villain to a look at the most underutilized character and worst plot twist, join us now 
	     in reflecting upon 2017 with our first annual The Flash superlatives!

      <p>Given the year Barry and Iris had, there’s no way we could honor anyone other than The Flash‘s central
	     couple with 2017’s Best Couple honor! 2017 proved to be quite the trying year for Barry and Iris whose love
	     and relationship was put to the ultimate test via a string of obstacles including their battle with Savitar,
	     Barry’s decision to abandon Iris and enter the Speed Force and Barry now being framed for a murder he never
	     committed. All of those hardships only helped to make the duo stronger with their highly anticipated wedding 
	     standing as one of the show’s most memorable moments yet!
