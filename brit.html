    LIGHT POLLUTION
  </h1>
  <div class="row">
    <section>
      <h2>London by night from the International Space Station. Earth's surface is becoming increasingly
	      illuminated by brighter artificial night light.
	  </h2>
      <p>But a little more than two centuries later, artificial lighting has spread across so much of
	     the planet that the darkness of night is steadily vanishing. Today, 80 percent of the world's 
	     population now lives in places where the sky glows at night from lights on streets and buildings.
	     Artificial light has become another form of pollution — one that scientists say poses threats
	     both to the natural environment and to human health. 
	  </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h6> &nbsp; </h6>
      <p>The extent of light pollution is evidenced by a November 2017 study in the journal Science Advances,
	     in which researchers used measurements taken by satellites to study the artificial brightness of Earth's
	     surface during nighttime. They found that between 2012 and 2016, the outdoor area that was artificially
	     lit grew at a rate of 2.2 percent per year. As more spaces are being illuminated, they've become brighter
	     as well, with the radiance of those areas increasing at an annual rate of 1.8 percent.
	  </p>
    </section>
    <section>
	  <h6> &nbsp; </h6>
      <p>As this summary of the findings in USA Today explains, the researchers found nighttime brightness stayed
	     the same in the U.S. and 38 other countries during the time period studied, while it increased in 79 countries 
	     — mostly in fast-developing areas in Asia, Africa and South America. Only 16 nations — including Syria, 
	     whose cities have been devastated by a brutal civil war — saw decreases in light. And artificial lighting
	     seems to be growing the fastest in areas that didn't have a lot of it until recently.
	  </p>
	</section>
  </div>
  <p> But those increases are just part of the story. Christopher Kyba, a scientist at the GFZ German Research Centre
      for Geosciences and the study's corresponding author, says in an email that the increasing transition to high-efficiency 
      LEDs for outdoor lighting, which have been touted as a way to reduce our dependence upon fossil fuels and slow climate
      change, may not be saving as much electricity as envisioned."Despite great success with reducing energy for lighting in 
      specific projects — e.g., LED transitions in individual cities — cheaper light seems to be leading to increased use,"
      Kyba explains. "That means that LEDs overall aren't reducing total energy consumption for outdoor lighting anywhere
      near as much as it would appear."
  </p>
  <p>Worse yet, there's growing evidence that our excess illumination is having harmful effects on people. In 2016, the American
     Medical Association issued a warning that the conversion to high-intensity LED streetlights — which emit a large amount of blue 
     ight that increases glare — actually made it more difficult for drivers to see at night. The AMA added that the wavelengths 
     at which the lights operate suppress melatonin, a hormone that helps us to sleep.
  </p>
  <p>"Many terrestrial species are nocturnal, and electric lighting, especially dusk to dawn lighting, represents a complete disruption
     to the physical environment of these species," Dan Duriscoe, a retired physical scientist who worked at the National Park Service's
     Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division, explains in an email. "Imagine the daytime darkened artificially by a factor of 10, every day.
     What kind of impact would that have on diurnal species such as humans?"
