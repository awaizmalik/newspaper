    FOUR CUPS OF COFFEE A DAY

      <h2>Antioxidants are responsible</h2>
      <p>Drinking coffee is good for most people's health, a major review of medical evidence has concluded.
	     The drink is more likely to ward off disease than to cause harm, according to the most comprehensive
	     report yet conducted.Three to four cups a day confers the greatest benefit, the University of Southampton
	     researchers found, cu ing the risk of heart disease by 15 per cent and the chance of an early death by 17 
		 per cent.They also found evidence it reduces the chance of certain cancers, diabetes, liver disease and 
	     dementia.The scientists, whose report was published last night in the British Medical Journal, 
	     found drinking coffee in moderation is 'more likely to benefit health than harm'.

      <p>The scientists believe the antioxidant plant compounds in coffee are responsible for the benefits.
	     Decaffeinated coffee has a similar impact to the standard version, they found, suggesting the caffeine 
	     is not responsible for health benefits.'Roasted coffee is a complex mixture of over 1,000 bioactive compounds,
	     some with potentially therapeutic antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, or anticancer effects,' 
	     hey wrote.The research team, which also included experts from the University of Edinburgh, reviewed all 
	     the available evidence on coffee consumption, combining the findings of 201 published studies.They found
	     it had a major impact on heart problems, cutting the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by 15 per
	     cent and slashing the chance of a cardiovascular death by 19 per cent.

	  <h6> &nbsp; </h6>
      <p>The researchers found people who drank more than three cups a day did not tend to see any additional benefits
	     , and other studies have shown people who drink much more than this start to do themselves harm.The European Food
	     Safety Agency advises that people drink no more than four cups a day.It says those who drink more than this each
	     day run the risk anxiety, sleeplessness, heart rhythm disturbances or heart failure.

  <p>In an editorial also published in the BMJ, Eliseo Guallar of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
     said people should not start drinking coffee for health reasons.While overall it may be beneficial, some people may
     be at higher risk of adverse effects, he said, and there is 'substantial uncertainty' about the effects of higher levels
     of intake.Coffee is often drunk sugar and milk or cream, he said, which 'may independently contribute to adverse health outcomes'.
  </p>
  <p>Coffee is one of the world's most commonly consumed drinks, with an estimated 2.25billion cups drank around the 
     world each day.Its use is thought to date back to 11th-century Ethiopia, where legend says a goat herder noticed his 
     animals became energetic after eating the berries from a coffee tree.Until recently people were warned against
     drinking more than a few cups of coffee a day, for fear that it might cause cancer.
  </p>
  <p>But last year the World Health Organisation withdrew its previous warnings on the link between coffee and bladder
     cancer - and instead said that the drink could, in fact, help protect against certain cancers such as womb cancer 
     and liver cancer.Pregnant women are advised by the NHS to drink no more than two cups a day.
