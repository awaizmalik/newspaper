      <h2>West Brom head coach</h2>
      <p>Pardew took charge of his fifth Premier League club when he signed
	  a two-and-a-half-year deal at The Hawthorns on Wednesday, 11 months 
	  after he was sacked by Crystal Palace. Allardyce was also finalising 
	  terms to become Everton's new manager on Wednesday, having succeeded
	  Pardew at Palace only to leave the club after saving them from relegation
	  at the end of last season.</p>

      <h2>Australia captain Cameron Smith </h2>
      <p>Australia captain Cameron Smith was awarded the international rugby league
	  player of the year for the second time on Wednesday, three days before the Kangaroos
	  play England in the World Cup final. The goal-kicking hooker edged Tongan forward Jason
	  Taumalolo. England winger Jermaine McGillvary finished in third place in the Rugby League
	  International Federation Golden Boot Award voting.</p>

      <h2>Tiger Woodsâ€™ latest comeback pits golf</h2>
      <p>In truth, the cynic should be giving a couple of shots as the odds are firmly in their favour. 
	  And not just because Woods has not played competitively in 10 months because of a fourth back operation.
	  No, when it comes to Tiger and his comebacks, the cynic has an overload of spin and manipulation at which to roll his eyes.</p>
