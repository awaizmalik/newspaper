    LOVE IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MEREDITH

      <h2>Will Meredith find romance in the new year?</h2>
      <p>Though Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) seemed on track to finally lean into her romance with Riggs 
	     (Martin Henderson), Grey’s Anatomy surprisingly and swiftly brought that story to an end this fall
	     as Nathan got his happy ending with his formerly presumed dead fiancé. Still, Grey’s boss Krista
	     Vernoff is hopeful that Meredith will find romance in the future.“What is next for Meredith in 
	     terms of a love life remains to be seen,” Vernoff tells EW. “I believe that romance and love
	     are always a possibility, especially after we’ve lost the loves of our life. We have to evolve 
	     out of our immediate grief. I believe that immediate grief takes more than a couple of years. 
	     I don’t want to ever short-shrift the people who have gone through the death of a spouse and
	     say you just move on, or you just move on with the first person.”

      <p>Following Derek’s shocking death, Meredith had a brief (and disastrous) one night stand with 
	  Dr. Thorpe (Scott Elrod), before eventually beginning a casual romance out of shared grief with
	  Riggs. “I believe that Nathan served a beautiful purpose in Meredith’s life, which was to open 
	  her heart again and show her that she could care about someone again,” Vernoff says. “But that
	  doesn’t necessarily mean that person is your person for life. One of the things that I love that
	  we do on the show is show this very human journey.”.</p>

      <p>With all that said, Vernoff also notes that the Harper Avery Award-winning doctor isn’t defined 
	  by the men in her life, so romance can wait. “Love is possible for Meredith 100 percent,” she says,
	  “but it’s not her focal point.”</p>

  <p>Do you think you would like “Grey’s Anatomy” better if it took place in the Windy City? That was cr
     eator Shonda Rhimes’ original vision. But the Chicago native realized that “ER” was also set there, so 
     she changed the location of her show to Seattle to keep it unique, according to Elle.
  </p>
  <p>Rob Lowe was the producers’ first choice for the role of Derek Shepherd, a.k.a. McDreamy. When Lowe
     read the script, he loved it, but he had already signed on to do a show called “Dr. Vegas” on CBS. He
     decided to stick with CBS because ABC had experienced a previous series of flops, and he was afraid 
     “Grey’s” would share the same fate.Ironically, it was “Dr. Vegas” that ended up being canceled righ
     t away …and “Grey’s” is still going fast and furious! Patrick Dempsey ended up being the lucky acto
     r cast for the McDreamy role.

  <p>Then Ellen Pompeo got pregnant in season six, the crew had to get very clever when it came to hiding
     her growing bump. They did so by shooting her mainly from neck up. But once her size got too large to 
     hide, the writers gave her a storyline in which she donated part of her liver to her estranged dad, ac
     cording to the New York Post. This gave her some bedrest both on the show and off, as it eventually ga
     ve her time off for her maternity leave. Smart!
