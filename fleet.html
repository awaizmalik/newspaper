      <h2>Winner!</h2>
      <p>Apart from golf, walk the dog, definitely. It probably wouldn’t be appreciated this week,
	  but my dad starts his dog-walk to the right of the 18th green, goes all the way around past the 17,
	  to the back of 16th green and eventually gets to Hillside. It's a very cool walk. But my favourite 
	  is at the other end of Ainsdale, heading towards Pontins. There are sand hills and if you walk a mile,
	  mile and mile and half, you get to this massive sand dune. Once you get up there, you’re on the left
	  side of the 13th hole at Hillside and from the top you can see all across Southport to Blackpool.
	  It’s a beautiful picture, one that takes your breath away. 
	  I like to go up there and be silent for a few minutes and just take it all in. </p>

      <p>Southport in itself is up there with, say, St Andrews as a golfing town. There are so many courses, so many great courses. For me growing up Royal Birkdale wasn't a course that I would be playing on very often, although everybody by now knows I’d bunk on and play the odd shot when I was kid with my dad. Hillside is a great course, with one the best back nines you will see anywhere, and adjoins Birkdale, while nearby there is Formby Hall and I’m biased about that. It's my home course where I grew up playing and is a great test, very picturesque and full of memories for me. There’s also Southport municipal which is great fun and good value.</p>

      <p>I tell you what, you will not be short of a place to get a drink in Southport, no matter what the time. It’s changed, of course, since I used to go out there. I would go to The Pageant but that is shut now. Lord Street has always been a good place to go out, though. I’m hearing that the Sandgrounder is ok, while Eighty Eight is popular. If I was going for a drink, I’d go to either Ainsdale village or Birkdale village. My mum and dad live in Ainsdale and The Tipple and Harbour Café bar are both top spots.</p>

If I was going to go into Southport I would only go to The Vincent if I was going to eat. It’s the main hotel on Lord Street and does very nice meals. It’s the hotel where I would stay as well, although as my parents have always lived in the area I never had any need to stay in hotels in the town. There’s also the Ramada on the seafront and that has great views, and you cannot forget the Prince of Wales, which has so much history. And, of course, there are loads and loads of B&Bs, all very friendly.

There’s this Chinese takeaway on the coast road called Straits Kitchen and it’s monumentally good. Their sweet chilli boneless ribs are something else and I urge anyone and everyone to go and have a try. But Southport’s all about the fish-and-chips in a newspaper, isn’t it? Eating them on the beach when having a stroll. I reckon you might be surprised which golfers you see doing this in the evening after their rounds, although we are, of course, all athletes now!

I love Waterstones, it’s the best shop on earth as far as I’m concerned and there is one on the corner in town. I can spend hours in there just browsing. I love books, love the feel of them, look of them and am struggling to cross over to Kindle, even though it does make sense with my lifestyle. Much easier to lug around. I’ve just finished Great Expectations, which was a deep read. Yeah, I know, it is apt considering me going into this Open! In terms of other shops, there are loads of boutiques and menswear places to have a wander around.
